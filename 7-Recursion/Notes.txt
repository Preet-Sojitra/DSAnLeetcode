How to understand and approach the problem?

- Identify if we can break down problem into smaller problems.
- Write the recursive relation for the problem if needed.
- Draw the recursive tree
- About the recursive tree:
    - See the flow of functions, how they are getting in stack
    - Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
    - Draw the tree and pointer again and again using pen and paper
    - Use a debugger to see the flow of functions.
- See how the values are returned at each step
- See where the function will come out of the stack
